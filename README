Sorting Algorithm visualizer
Time for implementation - 12 hours
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I have implemented a sorting algorithm visualization with GUI using the 
raylib.h library and OOP concepts, thus creating an educative application,
mainly inspired by Nikola Kostadinov.
    The project only implements the Bubble Sort method, but is open to more
algorithms as it uses many functions and boolean variabiles in order to 
achieve its goal.
    The starting menu offers four options: changing the speed and size of
array, randomizing the array and starting the actual visualization.Once
started,each selected element of the pair will be coloured gray and, once it is
sorted, its color will be green.This was implemented with the pair type which
gives the possiblity to store both the value and the state of each element of
the array.
    Once the sorting is finished, a new visulization can be started, the user
being given the same four options.
    The raylib.h library facilitated the graphic interface of the application,
as it provides in-built functions for customizing the aspect of the project and
automizing the processes of pressing buttons.
